# Template for [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) projects for the [Cloud 9 IDE](https://c9.io/)

If you start a new Cloud 9 preject from this template, and then
install an Elm with ``npm install -g elm`` from IDE's terminal (``<Alt-T>``),
you will can

- build current module with ``<Ctrl-B>``
- view live app with ``Tools -> Preview -> Preview Running Application``
(using ``elm-reactor`` as usual)

Happy coding!
